Data Wrangling class projects and exams

This repository is a compendium of my own work and I give permission for public access to my work.

This repository contains code from the various homework assignments and exams in my QBS181 Data Wrangling course. We used sample code provided by the instructor to manipulate and perform various operations as well as open access code from R libraries.

Project 1
We utilized a SQL database provided by the instructor and performed operations including: renaming columns, creating new columns with information from existing columns, and creating a character value from a range of numerical values.

Project 2
We utilized a SQL database provided by the instructor in order to merge tables and perform various counts of the data.

Project 3
We used open access R libraries to manipulate data in data frames and find various characteristics of the data. We also performed simple web scraping techniques.

Midterm
We were given NHANES data and performed cleaning techniques such as converting characters to numbers, creating new columns, combining or separating columns, and renaming variables. This was performed in SQL and R.

Final
We utilized the above-mentioned SQL tables as well as a new table and merged tables, altered variables, and performed data analysis. This was done in both SQL and R.
